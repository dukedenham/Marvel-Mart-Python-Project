# Marvel-Mart-Python-Project

This is a project completed on a fictional department store called Marvel Mart and its orders from various different countries. The data was cleaned to fill missing values and correct erroneous values. Analytics reports were then completed to generate different statistics. This includes counts for different groups such as the number of orders for the top ten most sold to countries, descriptive statistics such as the average, maximum, and sum of total profit, and cross-reference statistics to create a new dataset (see [here](Countries_By_Region.csv)) that includes every country Marvel Mart sold to organized by region. Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and box plots were created to visualize these findings. From this information, I provided practical recommendations and insights to the company on where to build shipping centers, what item types/countries sell the most and have the most variance, and more.
