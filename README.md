# Marvel-Mart-Python-Project

This is a project completed on a fictional department store called Marvel Mart and its orders from various different countries. The data was cleaned to fill missing values and correct erroneous values. Analytics reports were then produced to generate different statistics such as counts for different sets of groups, descriptive statistics (averages, maximums, sums for multiple variables), distributions, and cross-reference statistics to create a new dataset with desired information. Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and box plots were created to visualize these findings. From this information, I provided practical recommendations and insights to the company on where to build shipping centers, the state of profits/sales for item types/countries, and more.

Files:
